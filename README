*** INTRODUCTION ***
inQuizition is a quiz web application written in HTML, CSS, and 
Javascript. 

*** STARTING A QUIZ ***
There are several different categories currently implemented 
with this application. Each category corresponds to a different 
question theme. A different theme will be randomly selected
each day, and each quiz consists of ten questions, randomly 
selected, from the question pool corresponding to the day's 
quiz theme.

Start the quiz by pressing the "Start" button. Upon start, 
one of two question types will be presented: multiple choice
or input. 

*** QUESTION TYPES ***
A multiple choice question will list four possible
answers for the question. The user must first select an 
answer and then press the checkmark button in the bottom right
to submit the answer. The checkmark button will not be active
until the user selects an option.

An input question will have an empty text field for the user
to fill in with their response. Once filled in, the user must
press the checkmark button at the bottom right to submit their
answer. The answer will be checked, by character, against the 
expected input. 

*** PAUSING AND QUITTING ***
To quit or pause the quiz, press the 'x' button at the bottom 
left corner of the screen. A popup will appear, confirming
whether you would like to quit. If pausing, press "No" in 
order to return to the quiz. If qutting, press "Yes" in order
to return to the start popup.

*** SCORES ***
The scores will be shown in the top left and right of the screen.
The accumulated score from correct answers will be shown at
the top left, while the accumulated incorrect score will be 
shown at the top right. At the end of the quiz, the score of
the correctly answered questions will be displayed.

*** TIMER ***
Each question has a limited amount of time allowed for answering.
The time is displayed to the user by the series of seven bars
between the two score fields. The bars will all start out with
solid opacity at the beginning of a question. Over time, the bars
will begin to fade out from the rightmost to the leftmost. When
the leftmost bar becomes completely opaque, the time for the 
question has expired. Upon time expiry, if an answer is selected
or has been inputted, it will be submitted and treated as a normal
input. Otherwise, the question will be counted as answered
incorrectly.

*** FINISHING THE QUIZ ***
There are a total of ten questions per quiz. At the end of the
tenth question, the quiz will stop and there will be a popup
displaying the total correct score accumulated during the quiz.
There will also be a button allowing the user to return to the
start menu.
